(4) To give us a sense of your computer science experience, please complete the following task. Use either Python or PHP for your answer.

Write a function that takes 2 colors as arguments and returns the average color.
* The parameters will be two 6-digit hexadecimal strings. This does not need to be validated.
* The return value should be a 6-digit hexadecimal string.
* The hexadecimal strings represent colors in RGB, much like in CSS.
* The average color is to be determined by taking the arithmetic mean for each component: red, green and blue.
